# Visual Analytics Project 1

**This is a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/fakhar23/visual-analytics-project1) containing the implementation for the first of two group projects for the course "Visuelle Datenanalyse" during my Master's studies.**
The task was to explore a dataset from the Graph Drawing 2023 Contest (https://mozart.diei.unipg.it/gdcontest/2023/creative/), which collected data from BoardGameGeek about board games and subsequently design and implement interesting visualizations from this data.
The visualizations were created using a mixture of JavaScript, HTML and CSS and contain different parameters that the user can interact with.
To get the necessary packages, first install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run the following commands:
Run this command to go through the initialization process:

```bash
npm init
```

To install the packages run the following:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the webserver containing the visualizations run the following:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Lastly, to reach the webserver, go to http://localhost:5173/ in your browser of choice.
